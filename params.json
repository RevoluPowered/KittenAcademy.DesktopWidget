I created this because I was really enjoying the kitten academy live stream, additionally I can't have cats in my apartment; this really is the next best thing.\r\n\r\nThis software was made in a very short period of time, expect bugs, report them.\r\n\r\nShould you just want a link to their stream, watch here:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPv9yKC76hE\r\n\r\nI strongly encourage you to donate to them; if you like my software, donate to them:\r\n\r\nhttp://kitten.academy/donations/\r\n\r\n## This software was built freely, with permission:\r\nhttp://kitten.academy/\r\n\r\nThe application is not officially sponsored by Kitten Academy.\r\n\r\nThe project is licensed in this way:\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n\r\nThe licence file is in the project, and supplied in all the builds.\r\n",
